A batteries included template for [Protostar](https://github.com/software-mansion/protostar)-based Cairo projects on StarkNet.

## Getting Started

Click `Use this template` on GitHub to create a new repository with this project as the initial state.

Run `protostar install` inside that directory once cloned locally.

You can build with `protostar build` and test with (you guessed it) `protostar test`

Check out the [protostar docs](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/tutorials/guides/testing) for more information about what the toolchain can do.
